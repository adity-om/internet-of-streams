# Internet of Streams Project

Building a wireless sensor platform from (almost) scratch in Embedded Rust. Built with a focus on teaching embedded systems, IoT development, and Rust through live streamed coding sessions. Devices based on the [DWM1001-DEV] board, the [Nordic nRF52] microcontroller, and [Embedded Rust].

    * Get messages sending periodically
    * Receive incoming messages
    * Use the hardware random number generator
    * Serialize/Deserialize messages with `ssmarshal` and `serde`
* [2019-03-17] - **Workspace Cleanup and Alarm Clock Planning**
    * Discuss making an alarm clock as a first device
    * Discuss RTCs and how they work
    * Refactor the repo into a workspace
* [2019-03-20] - **Real Time Clock - Part 1**
    * Start implementing the nRF52 RTC peripheral
    * Write a low level peripheral driver
    * Add an interrupt handler to RTFM
    * Got stuck due to some code problems
* [2019-03-28] - **Real Time Clock - Part 2**
    * Debugging a low level peripheral driver
    * Investigating what went wrong
    * Got the RTC interrupt working properly!
* [2019-03-31] - **Making an Alarm Clock - Part 1**
    * Reviewed the [`uhr` crate] for tracking wall time and alarms
    * Implemented a (re-)scheduler to allow alarms to repeat on a fixed weekly basis schedule
    * Wrote a no_std unit test for verifying an optimized bit-math algorithm
